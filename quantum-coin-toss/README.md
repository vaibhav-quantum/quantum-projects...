# Quantum Coin Toss

## Objective
Simulate a fair coin using quantum superposition.

## Concepts Used
- Qubit
- Hadamard Gate
- Measurement

## Tools
- Python
- Qiskit

## Explanation
A Hadamard gate places the qubit into a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩.
Upon measurement, the state collapses randomly, producing a 50–50 outcome.
Repeated measurements reveal the probability distribution....
