Quantum Projects

Learning quantum computing through small, focused experiments...

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in quantum computing..
It contains a growing set of experiments built to understand core ideas clearly before moving on to more advanced topics..
The focus is on depth, correctness, and clarity, rather than rushing through material..

Repository Structure
This is a single Git repository with no nested repos.
Each project lives in its own folder and includes:-
                                                  Source code for the experiment
                                                  Output files such as plots or results 
                                                  A short README explaining the idea and observations
                                                  The structure mirrors how technical and research work is typically organized.

Topics Covered
So far, the work here covers:-
                             Qubits and superposition
                             The Hadamard gate
                             Quantum measurement and randomness
                             Multi-qubit systems and exponential scaling
                             Basic probability analysis and visualization

Future work will include entanglement, multi-qubit measurements, introductory quantum algorithms, and experiments on real quantum hardware.

Tools:-
      Python
      Qiskit (IBM Quantum)
      Matplotlib
      QASM simulator and real backends
      Git and GitHub

**Note**
This repository is intended as both a learning log and a technical portfolio.
If you’re exploring quantum computing yourself, you may find the progression useful.

**Feedback**
Suggestions or constructive feedback are always welcome.
