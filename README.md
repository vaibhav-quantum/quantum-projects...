**Quantum Projects**

**Learning quantum computing through hands-on experiments..**

This repository documents my learning journey in quantum computing, focusing on building intuition through small, well-scoped experiments rather than rushing through advanced topics...

**Structur**e

This is a single Git repository with no nested repos...

**Each project includes:-**

                      Experiment code
                      Generated outputs (plots/results)
                      A brief README explaining the idea

**Topics Covered so far:-**
                      Qubits and superposition
                      Hadamard gate
                      Measurement and randomness
                      Multi-qubit systems and exponential scaling
                      Probability visualization

**Upcoming:-**

                      Entanglement and correlations
                      Multi-qubit measurements
                      Introductory quantum algorithms
                      Experiments on real quantum hardware

**Tools**

     Python
     Qiskit (IBM Quantum)
     Matplotlib
     QASM simulator and real backends
     Git & GitHub

**Note**

This repository is both a learning log and a growing technical portfolio...
