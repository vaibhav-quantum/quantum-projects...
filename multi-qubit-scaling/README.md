# Multi-Qubit State Space & Exponential Scaling

This project demonstrates how quantum state space grows exponentially
with the number of qubits, even without entanglement...

## Key Insight
An n-qubit quantum system represents 2ⁿ basis states simultaneously,which explains why large quantum systems cannot be efficiently simulated on classical computers...

## Experiments
- 1 qubits → 2 states
- 2 qubits → 4 states
- 3 qubits → 8 states
